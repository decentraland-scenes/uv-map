## UV Map

A simple scene that shows a spritesheet animation of a robot talking.

This scene shows you:

- How to map a portion of a texture onto a plane
- How to change the mapped portion of a texture frame by frame to produce a 2D frame by frame animation

A PlaneShape uses a spritesheet as texture, selecting only a region of the image. The selected region is changed on every frame, to simulate movement.

This is the image used as a spritesheet:

> Note: Event though this is not how we animated the robots in Genesis Plaza in the end, it's still a valuable example for other spritesheet implementations.
